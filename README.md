# 🎯 Morse Warriorz

A minimalist morse code learning platform with interactive converters, memorable phrases, and practice exercises.

## 💡 Why This Exists

- This project was born from a spontaneous moment of curiosity - one day I suddenly had the urge to learn Morse code just to pass time. Then i straight went to youtube to check about morse code and one of the video I watched, I used it as a refernce to create a section in the website. 
- Instead of using existing tools, I decided to create my own website with an intuitive, fun, and easy-to-use interface. The goal was to build something I could always refer back to for anything Morse code related, while making the learning experience enjoyable and accessible.

## 🚀 What It Does

This website helps you learn morse code through multiple interactive tools:
- Convert text to morse code and vice versa
- Listen to morse code audio with authentic dot and dash sounds
- Learn letters A-Z using memorable phrases (e.g., "a PART" for A = •—)
- Practice with letter/number quizzes
- Reference complete morse code alphabet with audio

## ✨ Features

- **Text ↔ Morse Converter** - Real-time conversion between text and morse code
- **Audio Playback** - Hear morse code with Web Audio API generated sounds
